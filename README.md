# Competitor Marketing Monitor - n8n Workflow

## üìã Overview

Automated competitor intelligence system that monitors marketing copy changes across financial software competitor websites. Tracks headlines, pricing, benefits, and CTAs monthly, automatically posting significant changes to Notion.

**Monitored Competitors:**
- TaxPlanIQ (Tax planning software for CPAs)
- FP Alpha (AI-driven financial planning platform)
- RightCapital (Financial planning software)
- TaxStatus (IRS record monitoring platform)

## üéØ What This Workflow Does

1. **Scrapes** competitor websites monthly using Apify
2. **Extracts** key marketing elements (headlines, pricing, features, CTAs)
3. **Stores** snapshots in Airtable for historical tracking
4. **Compares** current data against previous snapshots
5. **Detects** significant changes using similarity scoring
6. **Posts** changes to Notion with significance ratings (1-10)
7. **Sends** summary email notifications

| URL | URL | - |

5. Share the database with your integration:
   - Click **Share** in top right
   - Invite your integration
6. Copy the Database ID from the URL (32-character string)

### Step 4: Import n8n Workflow

1. Copy the entire `n8n_workflow` JSON from the configuration file
2. In n8n, go to **Workflows** ‚Üí **Import from URL or File**
3. Paste the JSON and click **Import**
4. The workflow will be imported with all nodes configured

### Step 5: Configure the Workflow

2. Monitor execution in real-time
3. Check results:
   - ‚úÖ Airtable Snapshots table should have 4 new entries
   - ‚úÖ If changes detected, Changes table will have entries
   - ‚úÖ Notion database will show any changes
   - ‚úÖ You'll receive a summary email

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Adjusting Schedule

The workflow runs on the 1st of each month at 9 AM. To change:

1. Open **Monthly Trigger** node
2. Modify cron expression:
   - **Monthly**: `0 9 1 * *` (current)
   - **Bi-weekly**: `0 9 1,15 * *`
   - **Weekly**: `0 9 * * 1`
   - **Daily**: `0 9 * * *` (not recommended for this use case)

### Adding New Competitors

1. Open **Set Competitors** node
2. Add new assignment:
```javascript
{
  "name": "Competitor Name",
  "url": "https://competitor.com/",
  "actorId": "your-apify-actor-id",
  "selectors": {
    "headline": "h1, .hero-headline",
    "pricing": ".pricing-section, [class*='price']",
    "benefits": ".benefit, .feature",
    "cta": ".btn-primary, .cta-button"
  }
}
```
3. Update Airtable and Notion Select fields to include new competitor

### Adjusting Change Detection Sensitivity

Change detection uses similarity scoring. To adjust:

1. Open **Compare Changes** node (Code node)
2. Find the similarity thresholds:
   - **Headline**: Line with `if (similarity < 0.8)` - default 80%
   - **Title**: Line with `if (similarity < 0.9)` - default 90%
3. Lower values = more sensitive (detects smaller changes)
4. Higher values = less sensitive (only major changes)

### Customizing Significance Scoring

Significance scores (1-10) help prioritize changes:

In **Compare Changes** node:
```javascript
// Current scoring:
headline changes: (1 - similarity) * 10  // Up to 10 points
title changes: (1 - similarity) * 8      // Up to 8 points
pricing changes: 9                        // Always high priority
benefits changes: 7                       // Medium-high priority
```

Modify these multipliers based on what matters most to your analysis.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Data Being Scraped

**Symptoms**: Empty snapshots in Airtable

**Solutions**:
1. Test Apify actor directly with a competitor URL
2. Check Apify execution logs for errors
3. Verify CSS selectors are correct (websites may have changed)
4. Ensure Apify has sufficient credits

**Debug Steps**:
```bash
# Test a single competitor manually in Apify console
{
  "startUrls": [{"url": "https://www.taxplaniq.com/"}]
}
```

### No Changes Detected

**Symptoms**: Workflow runs but never finds changes

**Solutions**:
1. Lower similarity threshold in Compare Changes node
2. Verify previous snapshots exist in Airtable
3. Check that data format is consistent between runs
4. Review Airtable filterByFormula in Get Previous Snapshot node

**Debug Steps**:
1. Manually compare two snapshots in Airtable
2. Add `console.log` statements in Compare Changes node
3. Check n8n execution logs for comparison results

### Notion Not Updating

**Symptoms**: Changes detected but not appearing in Notion

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Notion integration token is valid
2. Check database is shared with integration
3. Confirm database ID is correct
4. Ensure property names match exactly (case-sensitive)
5. Check Notion API rate limits

**Test Notion Connection**:
```bash
# In n8n, create a test workflow with just the Notion node
# Try creating a simple page to verify credentials
```

### Airtable API Errors

**Symptoms**: "Invalid API key" or "Base not found" errors

**Solutions**:
1. Regenerate API key at airtable.com/account
2. Verify Base ID starts with "app" (not the base name)
3. Check API key has correct permissions
4. Ensure tables exist with exact names: "Snapshots" and "Changes"

### Email Not Sending

**Symptoms**: Workflow completes but no email received

**Solutions**:
1. Check n8n email configuration (SMTP settings)
2. Verify FROM_EMAIL and TO_EMAIL are correct
3. Check spam folder
4. For n8n Cloud: ensure email node is configured with credentials

## üìà Usage Tips

### First Run Behavior
- First execution creates baseline snapshots
- No changes will be detected (nothing to compare against)
- Run twice to test change detection

### Testing Change Detection
1. Run workflow to create initial snapshot
2. Manually modify a snapshot in Airtable
3. Run workflow again - should detect your modification

### Monitoring Workflow Health
- Check n8n execution history weekly
- Review Airtable for consistent data format
- Verify Apify actor runs successfully
- Monitor Notion for change frequency

### Best Practices
1. **Run manually first** before scheduling
2. **Test with one competitor** before enabling all four
3. **Review significance scores** monthly and adjust thresholds
4. **Update CSS selectors** when websites redesign
5. **Archive old snapshots** quarterly (keep last 12 months)

## üîí Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use n8n's credential system for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys quarterly
- Use separate keys for dev/production

### Data Privacy
- Competitor data is public information
- Ensure your Airtable base has appropriate permissions
- Don't share Notion database publicly unless intentional
- Review data retention policies
